This is a collection of [Manual](https://github.com/ManualForArchipelago) apworld implementations for [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg/).

Included so far:  
Every mainline Touhou game (6-8, 10-18)  
Touhou 14.3  

I will include a readme for how to use each Manual in a release for that Manual, alongside the apworld and a template YAML.
To use one of these, you'll need a local Archipelago installation as well as a recent Manual client. Simply place the .apworld file in your Archipelago installations custom_worlds folder, and you're ready to play.

Enjoy!
